## About Me <a id="me"></a>

I am an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Mathematics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).  I am currently a Research Assistant in the research group led by [Prof. Gary Choi](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~ptchoi/index.html).

My research focuses on Generative AI and Computational Biology. Specifically, I work on accelerating score-based diffusion models using numerical methods and quantifying complex biological shapes through geometric analysis.  I recently served as a Visiting Scholar at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Justin Wan](https://uwaterloo.ca/current-graduate-students/contacts/justin-wan).
